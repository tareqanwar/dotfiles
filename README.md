# dotfiles
Ubuntu/Debian configuration files.

### usage
Just run `./install.sh` to install zsh (including oh-my-zsh and other important stuff) and symlink all dotfiles.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tareqanwar/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

To keep up to date, you can just `pull` this repo, and re-run `./install.sh`.
